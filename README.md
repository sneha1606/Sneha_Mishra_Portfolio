I am an enthusiastic, data oriented Engineer-Mba having an acute interest in analytics. And this portfolio comprises of all the work I have done so far. 

# [Analytics Anywhere](https://analyticsanywhere.blogspot.com/)

'Analytics Anywhere' is a blog authored by me wherein the objective for this blog is to simplilfy the concepts of analytics, making it simpler to understand to the non-technical people and stakeholders. This blog simplifies and connects real world scenarios to the different concepts of analytics.

# [Projects:](https://github.com/sneha1606)

[*Project 1: Public Expenditure on Education*](https://github.com/sneha1606/Public-Expenditure-on-Education)

Overview:

Method Focused on: Data Visualisation
Tool Used: Python

Public expenditure is referred to as the expenditure incurred by the central government. The purpose of this study is to understand the public expenditure on education. The youth in India hold the major population. And thus education is considered to play a vital role in the development of the country. These analysis aimed to understand the pattern of the spending of the public expenditure that is being dedicated on the educational sector. The research carried out is a secondary research, and the data gathered for the conclusion and the analysis has been taken from trusted sources and public sites.  Statistical methods have been used to derive at the conclusion from the data obtained.
Some of the resultant visualisations are shown below:

[*Project 2: Heart Disease Prediction*](https://github.com/sneha1606/Heart-Disease/tree/master)

Overview:

Method Focused on: Linear Regression
Tool Used: Python

The goal is to predict the rate of heart disease (per 100,000 individuals) across the United States at the county-level from other socioeconomic indicators. The data is compiled from a wide range of sources . There are 33 variables in this dataset. Each row in the dataset represents a United States county, and the dataset we are working with covers two particular years, denoted a, and b We don't provide a unique identifier for an individual county, just a row_id for each row.
Linear regression is used for the following project as the distribution shown below:

[*Project 3: Manufacturing Unite Working or Not Prediction*](https://github.com/sneha1606/Heart-Disease-Risk)

Overview:

Method Focused on: Logistic Regression
Tool Used: Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Considering the indicators of sales, equivalent cash compensation, number of employees and the capital investment made in a manufacturing site, determine whether the site can still be operational or not. Also understand whether these predictors have effect on the functioning of the manufacturing site.

The Histogram to show the categorical varibale spread and th confusion Matrix for the project is displayed below:

[*Project 4: Heart Disease Risk Analysis*](https://github.com/sneha1606/Heart-Disease-Risk)

Overview:

Method Focused on: Linear Regression
Tool Used: Python

This project is used to analyse and predict the heart risk that can occur to a person considering the factors which are as followed, risk of heart disease depending on the blood pressure of the person, risk of heart disease and it erelation with the age and risk of heart disease for a smoker or a non smoker person. 

[*Project 5: Insurance Prediction*](https://github.com/sneha1606/Predict-insurance)

Overview:

Method Focused on: Linear Regression
Tool Used: Python

This project is used to predict a persons insurance charges which can be levied using the method of regression, the parameters such as bmi, age, sex, etc. are used to determine these charges.

[*Project 6: Elearn Portal Database*](https://github.com/sneha1606/Elearn-Portal-Database)

Overview:

Method Focused on: SQL
Tool Used: SQLite Studio / SQite3

The sudden shift towards the online educational methods due to the current pandemic has reulted in the boost of the softwares which provides a virtual platform for the institutes to connect in a better way with their students. This project aimed at developing a database for an elearning platform for such IT solutions which are provided to various schools and colleges etc. The planning for the database to be implemented included understanding the sector and creation of an Entity - Relationship Diagram (The below mentioned diagram is the ER-Diagram for elearn portal). An entire database using dummy data was created for implementation of the project.

[The ER - Diagram for the database is show below]
